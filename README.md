"Boredom is a developers creative playground" - Archit when bored

This script is nothing special, just a lightweight scraper for smogon forums for teams if you are too lazy to read through and get the teams yourself. This script will grab every `pokepast.es` link, `hastebin.com` link and `pastebin.com` link that is posted as well as every team that is directly posted in a code block

Skip the bullshit team explanations and introductions and just grab the teams and gen em / play em. My motivation for this was to just grab teams to test [PKHeX Auto Legality Mod](https://github.com/architdate/PKHeX-Plugins) team genning. Thought I'd share it with the world too.

## usage:

```bash
$ python smogteams.py <forum_url>
```

## features:

Scrapes from every page in the given forum thread. 

## goals that i will promise, but likely never do (you are welcome to pr tho):

- improve efficiency
- probably move to a better language?
- multithreading maybe? who knows.
